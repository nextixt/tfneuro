This is the simplest neural network that accepts two arrays of numbers as input, between which there is a certain pattern, which, if desired, you can always choose yourself. 
                The neural network finds this pattern, and then we let it enter a new number, which it processes according to the previously found pattern. 
                            If desired, you can change the input data for the neural network and change the number of epochs of its training.
                           ***The neural network is completely written in the Python programming language and uses the TensorFlow library.***
